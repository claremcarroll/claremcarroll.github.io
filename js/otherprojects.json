When the ideal perspective was achieved, the letters locked together, animated, and disappeared.<br><BR><img class=\"nodrop modalize\" src=\"../img/holodesign/hd4.png\"><br><br>I also explored the possibility of placing the letters more abstractly on 3D shapes.</p></div>",
			"content4":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>Typographic Exploration</h1></div> <div class=\"right\"><p><img  class=\"nodrop modalize\" src=\"../img/holodesign/hd5.png\"><br><BR>I did a large typographic exploration to find different letterforms to use in the experience.</p></div>",
			"content5":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>Final Design</h1></div> <div class=\"right\"><p>I took each one of my chosen type faces and broke them up into small pieces and brought them into Unity as sprites. At first I manually scaled and placed the pieces throughout the scene, but I found that this approach made the experience ideal for only users of a particular height. The distortion of the space in Unity was also not the same as in the Hololens, so I decided to assign each segment a random vector at runtime and let it move along that vector based on the distance of a user to a point, regardless of the y coordinate. I deployed the project on the Hololens and demoed it at the course showcase.</p></div>",
