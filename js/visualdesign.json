			"content1":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>About the Project</h1></div><div class=\"right\"><p>For this project, my audience was Walt Disney World vendors and front-line service employees. My biggest challenge was addressing both audiences in a meaningful way through an internal-facing document. To solve this, I created a quarterly report called “Backstage Disney.” I imagined that the vendors would read this report to see how they could adapt some of Disney’s successful business techniques in their own companies. I created callouts, highlighted in yellow, specifically to list some of these techniques so that vendors could skim the document easily. For the front-line employees or “cast members,” the quarterly report would highlight individual and company projects. I imagined that the front-line service employees would pick up the report to see which of their colleagues are featured in the current issue and to see what Disney is doing in service to their communities.</p></div>",
			"content2":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>Grid</h1></div><div class=\"right\"><p>Although Disney is a playful brand, I chose a traditional 2 column grid to emphasize professionalism and to allow me to make playful decisions elsewhere later.<Br><br><img class=\"nodrop modalize\" src=\"../img/report/version2.png\"></p></div>",
			"content3":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>Ideation</h1></div><div class=\"right\"><p>I did a round of broad ideation of different concepts for the report. Many of these ideas leaned far too “playful storybook” and didn’t have enough meaningful weight behind them. I chose to pursue the third idea below.<br><br><img class=\"nodrop modalize\" src=\"../img/report/version3.png\"></p></div>",
			"content5":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>Iteration</h1></div><div class=\"right\"><p>After scoping down to this idea, I played with some more color concepts and ideated on how callouts, quotes, and other standard elements might appear. I decided that the teal wasn’t doing any favors for the content of the report and decided to switch back to green.<br><br><img class=\"nodrop modalize\" src=\"../img/report/version4.png\"></p></div>",
			"content6":"<div class=\"left\"><h1>Refinement</h1></div><div class=\"right\"><p>In order to give the report more meaning, I created a fake publication called “Disney Backstage” and decided this industrial ecology report was their Fall issue. Some of my elements were still to big and childish for a formal report so I continued to iterate on them.<br><br><img class=\"nodrop modalize\" src=\"../img/report/version5.png\"></p></div>",
