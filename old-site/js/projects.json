The application has two parts: the scavenger hunt and the AR playroom.<br><br> The scavenger hunt portion of the application gives users hints and asks them to find and click on different items throughout Maisy's house. To create this, I created Vuforia image targets of items throughout the pop-up book and created corresponding After Effects animations that are played when the image target is in view.<br><br>For the playroom, I surveyed many of Cousins’s books and created different scenes for Maisy and her friends to play in. The purpose of this was to link the many of Cousins’s books to the pop-up books so that users get excited about reading the books and apply what they read about to their playtime. I also created an AR marker for Maisy and one for her friend. By tapping on Maisy, users can cycle between the scene. When this happens, both Maisy and her friends’ costumes change to fit the scene.<\/p>",

We surveyed each piece of technology and brainstormed possible solutions. After this we determined the idea which we thought was most viable.<br><br>My team chose the connected scale technology and created a product called <i>Swivel<\/i>, an ergonomic office chair. Using the weight sensors in the seat and back, <i>Swivel<\/i> can determine when it is occupied, who is occupying it, and can provide real-time feedback regarding the occupant’s posture.<br><br>Swivel fulfills several needs in commercial office spaces, where poor ergonomics harmfully impact employee health and productivity. Additionally, it provides a rich set of data which employers can use to make their office space more intelligent and adaptive.<br><br>We created a concept video to demonstrate our idea.<\/p>",

Three.js has a lathe geometry object which takes a set of points and wraps them about an axis to create a geometry. I created an SVG parser which takes an SVG file and extracts the path to automatically create a geometry. This is how I constructed my tree.<br><br>I created the project for cardboard, but created a desktop version as well because of the differing navigational mental models.<\/p>",
