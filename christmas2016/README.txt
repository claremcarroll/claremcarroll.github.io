You must run a server to view these websites.
They are also hosted at claremarie.info/ssuiproj (web) and claremarie.info/ssuiprojmobile (mobile).
They both run on web and mobile, but each is optimized for one of these.
To adjust the stereo for a particular phone and cardboard, adjust the "stereoEffect.separation" found in the index.html of ssuimobile.

I wanted to do raytracing and build my own reticle for the mobile version, but it was very difficult to figure this out correctly in stereo, so I used a library.

I used the three.js documentation, tween.js documentation, and reticulum.js documentation and combed through a lot of stackoverflow questions.

I am using the following libraries: three.js , tween.js , and reticulum.js as well as the webvr boilerplate from eleVR.
